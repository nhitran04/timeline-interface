    <h1>Introduction to Polaris</h1>

    <p>With Polaris, a robot reads and performs instructions in <i>steps</i> 
        (i.e., from <i>top to bottom</i> in the numbered containers, as shown below).
    </p>

    <p>Instructions can be in the form of one of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>An <b>action</b>, which is <i>what the robot does</i>. For example, steps <b>#1</b> and <b>#3</b> are actions.</li>
            <li>A <b>goal</b>, which is <i>what the robot needs to achieve</i>. For example, steps <b>#2</b> and <b>#4</b> are goals.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="media/polaris_media/polaris_overview.png" width="25%">
    </div>

    <p>Now that you are familiar with how a robot reads and performs the instructions provided to it in Polaris, let's
        learn how you can use Polaris to give instructions to the robot to perform.</p>

    <p>We'll first learn how to use <b>actions</b> to specify instructions for the robot. After you are 
    comfortable with using actions, we will learn how to use <b>goals</b>.</p>
